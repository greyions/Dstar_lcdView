A simple python script to allow the use of the 16x2 RGB LCD Pi plate from
Adafruit so that I can view the callsigns while operating D-Star.

Usage:
	From a terminal run: sudo python lcdView.py

The Select button on the plate will exit the script, clear the screen and shut off the backlight.
The Right button will clear the screen
The Up button will display the IP address of the Pi and the current time.

I'm currently using this with the Maryland D-Star image for the Raspberry Pi. (http://http://maryland-dstar.org/index.html)

Please follow the instructions located at:
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c
https://learn.adafruit.com/character-lcd-with-raspberry-pi-or-beaglebone-black/usage
 to insure that your LCD plate is operating correctly before running this.

The startlcd.sh & startRemote.sh scripts allow the user to remotly log into the pi and start the lcd program or run both the lcd program and the remote program to change reflecters.
